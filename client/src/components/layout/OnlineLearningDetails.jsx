              <strong>Introduction</strong> to website development and programming (4 months): We
              start from the very beginning. We take it slowly, allowing you to
              learn without being overwhelmed. In addition to being able to ask
              your instructors questions, every CareerDevs student also receives
              a mentor (a student from Intermediate or Advanced), whom you can
              ask questions. By the end of the Introduction phase, youâ€™ve built
              your first full-stack application. Also, your friends now think
              youâ€™re weird. ðŸ™‚
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intermediate</strong> website development and programming (4 months). After
              completing the Introduction phase, you will have built up your
              confidence. You are now ready to learn more full-stack computer
              science concepts and build more robust websites and software
              programs. You are also eating algorithms for breakfast, building
              APIâ€™s, mastering recursion and can consider yourself an
              object-oriented developer. Most Impressive!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Advanced</strong> website development and programming (4 months). Yes, you
              are here now. You are now learning to master the most advanced,
              cutting edge & real-world software development concepts. You have
              developed several full-stack milestone software projects and a
              capstone project that would impress Bill Gates. Oh, by the wayâ€¦
              you are also earning $50,000 to $80,000 per year. No joke. Itâ€™s
              ok. Tell your friends and familyâ€¦ youâ€™re not bragging, you worked
              hard for this.
