          <br />
          <li>
            Introduction to website development and programming (4 months): We
            start from the very beginning. We take it slowly, allowing you to
            learn without being overwhelmed. In addition to being able to ask
            your instructors questions, every CareerDevs student also receives a
            mentor (a student from Intermediate or Advanced), whom you can ask
            questions. By the end of the Introduction phase, youâ€™ve built your
            first full-stack application. Also, your friends now think youâ€™re
            weird. ðŸ™‚
          </li>{" "}
          <br />
          <li>
            Intermediate website development and programming (4 months). After
            completing the Introduction phase, you will have built up your
            confidence. You are now ready to learn more full-stack computer
            science concepts and build more robust websites and software
            programs. You are also eating algorithms for breakfast, building
            APIâ€™s, mastering recursion and can consider yourself an
            object-oriented developer. Most Impressive!
          </li>{" "}
          <br />
          <li>
            Advanced website development and programming (4 months). Yes, you
            are here now. You are now learning to master the most advanced,
            cutting edge & real-world software development concepts. You have
            developed several full-stack milestone software projects and a
            capstone project that would impress Bill Gates. Oh, by the wayâ€¦ you
            are also earning $50,000 to $80,000 per year. No joke. Itâ€™s ok. Tell
            your friends and familyâ€¦ youâ€™re not bragging, you worked hard for
            this.
